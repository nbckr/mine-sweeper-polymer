            <h3>Quick Start</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you
                    click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without
                    clicking on any bombs) you win.
                </li>
                <li>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing
                    bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
                </li>
                <li>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point
                    and right-click.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>A square's &quot;neighbours&quot; are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4
                    diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not
                    wrap around the edges.
                </li>
                <li>If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can
                    cause a large area to automatically open.
                </li>
                <li>To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.</li>
                <li>The first square you open is never a bomb.</li>
                <li>If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect
                    bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
                </li>
                <li>You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--h3>Status Information</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The upper left corner contains the number of bombs left to find. The number will update as you mark
                    and unmark squares.
                </li>
                <li>The upper right corner contains a time counter. The timer will max out at 999 (16 minutes 39
                    seconds).
                </li>
                <li>Click on the time to switch to the number of moves counter. Click again to switch back to the
                    time.
                </li>
            </ul-->
