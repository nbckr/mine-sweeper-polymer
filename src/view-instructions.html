            <h3>Quick Start</h3>

            <div class="media">

                <div class="media-body">
                        <p>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't.
                            If you
                            click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares
                            (without
                            clicking on any bombs) you win.
                        </p>
                        <p>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares
                            containing
                            bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
                        </p>
                        <p>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb,
                            point
                            and right-click (or long-press if you're feeling touchy).
                        </p>

            <h3>Detailed Instructions</h3>

            <div class="media">
                <img src="/images/skull.svg" class="right">
                <div class="media-body">
                    <ul>
                        <p>A square's &quot;neighbours&quot; are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and
                            all 4
                            diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board
                            does not
                            wrap around the edges.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open.
                            This can
                            cause a large area to automatically open.
                        </p>
                        <p>To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.</p>
                        <p>The first square you open is never a bomb.</p>
                        <p>If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win.
                            Incorrect
                            bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
                        </p>
                        <p>You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
